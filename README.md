predict credit card approval based on machine learnin algorithms

## Summary
<p>
The goal of this project to predict credit card approval based on machine learnin algorithms.
In principle the data science workflow conducted here could be incorporated into 
a production system supporting financial instutitions like banks or other financial service companies
to make decisions in short time frames. The decision boils down to approve or reject the application
for a credit card.

<p>
The data set used here is the Credit Approval Data Set taken from the 
<a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/credit+approval">UCI Machine Learning Repository</a>.
</p> 

<p>
This project in applies the many parts of the data science life cycle from data exploration, data cleaning, feature selection, data preprocessing and machine learning. These methods are
applied:

<li>statistics</li>
<li>data aggregation</li>
<li>data visualization</li>
<li>data cleaning</li>
<li>imputing missing values</li>
<li>converting features to numerics</li>
<li>label encoding</li>
<li>frequency encoding</li>
<li>data preprocessing</li>
<li>feature selection on ground of <br>
